Multiplying a successor:

Theorem: m.(Sn) = m.n + m
Proof:

By induction on m: N
Base case: 0* Sn
    =<Zero of *>

    Induction step:
    Sm * Sn = Sm * n + m
        By inductio on 'n: N' (doing induction on original theorem: Sm * S n = S m * n + S m)
            Induction step
            Sm * Sn
            = <succ of *>
            Sm + m(Sm)
            =Inudction hypothesis
            Sn + mn + m

if more than one hypothesis, you can use both induction hypotheses
